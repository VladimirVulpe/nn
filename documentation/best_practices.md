**Bias-Variance Tradeoff** = in order to have a good model, you need one with **low bias** and **low variance**<br>

Two ways to **combat overfitting**: <br> 
1. **Use more training data**. The more you have, the harder it is to overfit the data by learning too much from any single training example.
2. **Use regularization**. Add in a penalty in the loss function for building a model that assigns too much explanatory power to any one feature or allows too many features to be taken into account.
